,Solution,Reasoning,Confidence
0,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that Option A is the correct answer. Their reasoning that the lazy farmer being the mother of the diligent farmer fits with the information provided - that the lazy farmer is a parent of the diligent farmer, but not the father. This logically leads to the conclusion that the lazy farmer must be the mother. The agents provide sound explanations supporting this answer choice.",0.95
1,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that Option C is correct. Their explanation that Romeo and Juliet were likely fish whose tank broke from the train vibrations aligns with the details provided in the question - glass shards, water, sparse furniture, and proximity to a train track. This provides the most plausible account for their deaths compared to the other answer choices. The reasoning of the agents is logical.",0.95
2,C,"I agree with Agents 1 and 2 that Option C is the right answer. Their reasoning that the day before one's birthday, they are one year younger than the next day on their birthday is sound. This occurs every year without exception. Agent 3's claim that this only happens after graduation is incorrect.  ",1.0
3,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that Option B is correct. As they explain, if an assistant captain leaves a team, the main captain would take on their duties, as they are next in the hierarchy. The role would not automatically transfer to another officer. The agents provide logical reasoning for why the captain would serve in this situation.",0.95  
4,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that Option C is the answer. Their mathematical logic that 5% of a sample of 100 people is 5 people is sound. Since 5% of the city has unlisted numbers, 5 people out of 100 randomly selected would be expected to have unlisted numbers. The agents' reasoning and calculation align.  ",1.0
5,A,I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that the answer is A. Their reasoning that the guards were likely facing each other rather than back-to-back makes logical sense for how one guard could see the other smiling. Agent 2 also provides good supporting detail about the guards needing to position themselves to monitor both directions of the road.,0.95
6,A,"I concur with Agents 1 and 3 that answer A is correct. Their explanation that a house cannot physically jump, making it impossible for the neighbor to win the bet, identifies the key logic twist. Agent 2's mention of a small house seems overly specific based on the bet details provided.",0.95
7,B,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that B is the answer. Their mathematical explanation that 100 divided by 10 equals 10, and further division would yield a decimal, is sound. Agent 2 mentions an additional step but I agree performing the division once is the direct solution.",1.0
8,A,I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that A is correct. Their straightforward math showing 10% of 200 is 20 criminals provides clear logic based on the information given. Agent 2 attempts a more indirect approach without the given data needed.  ,1.0
9,B,I concur with Agents 2 and 3 that B is the right answer. Their explanation that Christmas and New Year's occur within the same calendar year annually is logically accurate. Agent 1 is incorrect about them falling in different years.,1.0
10,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that B is the answer. Their scientific reasoning that roosters are male chickens and cannot lay eggs convincingly explains the lack of eggs produced. The agents provide aligned biological facts.",1.0
11,D,"I agree with Agent 1 that there is insufficient information provided to justify selecting any of the answer choices confidently. More context would be needed about the type of playground, Mark's interests, the announcement, etc.",0.9
12,C,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the answer. Their logical interpretation that the dry man was in a coffin at his own funeral while the others got wet running in the rain provides a sound twist that fits the question details.",0.95
13,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that answer A makes sense. Their reasoning that the woman was likely at a zoo where bears are safely enclosed convincingly explains her lack of fear and excitement.",0.95
14,B,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that B is the most logical answer. Their explanations that adjacent or wall-to-wall houses would allow the man to feasibly jump between them are reasonable based on the limited scenario details provided.",0.95
15,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that B is the correct answer. Their reasoning that the accountant being the attorney's sister logically reconciles both statements without lying is sound. The ambiguity of the term ""sibling"" allows both testimonies to be true.",0.95
16,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2, and 3 that answer A makes sense. As they explain, if the accountant is the attorney's sister, she could truthfully call him her brother while the attorney has no brother. The ambiguity around ""sibling"" allows both statements to be true.",0.95
17,C,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the logical answer. Their reasoning that the group consists of a daughter, mother (who is also a daughter), and grandmother logically accounts for the 2 mothers and 2 daughters while allowing the $7 split.",0.95
18,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the correct answer. Their explanation that all 9 children being boys would mean half are boys logically follows based on the question details provided. The agents give sound interpretations.",0.95
19,A,"After reviewing the agents' explanations, I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that A is the right answer. Their step-by-step reasoning of taking each of the 3 doses every 30 minutes for a total of 1.5 hours matches the details given.  ",1.0
20,A,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that A is correct. Their explanation that a house cannot physically jump, making the man's bet impossible to lose, identifies the key logic twist.",0.95
21,A,"I agree with Agent 2 that answer A makes the most sense based on the limited information provided. Options B and C introduce unlikely scenarios not supported by the details given. If the ground was not wet, it logically explains how the person's feet stayed dry.",0.95
22,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that answer B is correct. As they logically explain, roosters do not lay eggs as male chickens. Therefore, the scenario is not scientifically possible.  ",1.0
23,A,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that A is the answer. Their reasoning that James was likely in a zoo, explaining the bears' lack of attack, is logically sound based on the question details.",0.95
24,A,"After reviewing the agents' explanations, I agree with Agents 2 and 3 that A is correct. Their step-by-step logic of taking each pill every 30 minutes for a total of 1.5 hours matches the details provided.",1.0
25,A,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that answer A is correct. As they explain, subtracting 10 from 100 once yields 90, and further subtractions do not produce whole numbers.  ",1.0
26,A,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that A logically explains the apparent contradiction. As they describe, if the girls are triplets, they share background yet have distinct identities. This aligns with the given statements.",0.95
27,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the logical answer. Their reasoning that Romeo and Juliet being fish whose tank likely broke from the train vibrations fits the details provided, including the glass, water, and proximity to the railroad tracks. This provides a reasonable account for their deaths compared to the other limited options.",0.9
28,A,"I concur with Agents 1 and 3 that A makes the most sense. As they explain, if the vice coach is absent, the head coach would naturally take over leading the team as the next in line. Agent 2's suggestion of the captain does not align as cleanly with the coaching hierarchy.",0.95
29,C,"I agree with Agent 1 that C is the best answer. Their reasoning that the scream indicates John had the gun, and the mailman being the only male present allows the officer to deduce he was John, logically follows the information provided. The other agents' explanations rely on unnecessary assumptions.",0.8
30,A,"After reviewing the agents' explanations, I agree with Agents 2 and 3 that A is the most logical answer. As they state, older adults may require specific dietary adjustments to address age-related health changes, which provides a sound reason for increased consumption.",0.9
31,C,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C makes the most sense. Their reasoning that Jack being a fish knocked from the ocean could plausibly die within minutes out of water logically aligns with the unusual scenario described.  ",0.9
32,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the answer. Their explanation that the fat dog being the slim dog's mother matches the parental relationship described, as she is not specified as the father. The reasoning is logically sound.",1.0
33,C,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is correct. Their scientific reasoning that roosters cannot lay eggs logically explains why the scenario described could not occur. The agents provide accurate, aligned facts.",1.0
34,C,I agree with Agents 2 and 3 that C makes the most sense. Their reasoning that a statue/photograph would stay dry while others rushed for cover logically reconciles the unusual scenario. Agent 1's suggestion is also reasonable.,0.85
35,C,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the answer is C. If there is a grandmother present along with a mother and daughter, that accounts for the ""two mothers"" (the mother and grandmother) and ""two daughters"" (the daughter and her mother who is the grandmother's daughter). This equals three people who can split the $21 equally.",1.0
36,B,I agree with Agents one and three that 5% of 100 people randomly selected would equal 5 people with unlisted numbers. Agent two's logic that a phone directory contains only listed numbers is flawed.,1.0
37,A,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that answer A makes the most sense - if the man was in a coffin at his own funeral, that explains why he remained dry while the others fled and got wet in the rain.",1.0
38,C,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that Jack and Tom being brothers with the same parents enables the $40 to be split equally among the four of them. This is the only logical explanation.",1.0
39,C,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that answer C is correct. The logic that black sheep absorb more heat from sunlight, potentially causing them to eat less to regulate body temperature, explains the differing food consumption.",0.9
40,B,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the woman was likely at a zoo, explaining why she was excited instead of afraid to see a bear from a safe distance.",1.0
41,B,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that John cleverly predicted the score would be 0-0 before the start of the game, an easy correct prediction that led Tom to lose the bet.",1.0
42,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that John used the same clever score prediction tactic for the basketball game, stating the score would be 0-0 before tipoff, causing Tom to lose this bet as well.",1.0
43,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the captain would take over leadership duties if the assistant captain resigned from the team. This follows the typical hierarchy.",1.0
44,B,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that you can only subtract 10 from 100 twice before reaching zero, making B the correct answer.",1.0
45,C,"I agree with Agent one that if all 11 sheep are white, then half of 11 sheep (5.5 rounded up to 6 sheep) would be white. Agents two and three's answers are flawed.",1.0
46,C,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that if the officer was actually James's sister, her statement makes sense along with James having no brother.",1.0
47,C,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that if all 9 children are boys, half of them (4.5 rounded to 5) would be male.",1.0
48,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the boys being triplets would allow them to share parents, house, birthdate but still not be twins.",1.0
49,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that if the ground was dry, there would be no need for the third man to take special measures to keep his feet dry. This explains why his feet remain dry despite not wearing boots.",1.0
50,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that John cleverly predicted the football game score would be 0-0 before start, which is always correct, causing Tom to lose the bet.  ",1.0
51,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the mailman being the only male present allowed the officer to quickly deduce ""John"" referred to him when hearing that statement.",1.0
52,C,"I agree with Agent three that with 5 stops of 30 minutes each, the total stop time is 2 hours. Agents one and two did not account for all the stops.",1.0
53,B,I agree with Agent one that a circular tank would allow the fish to see each other periodically while swimming opposite ways around the ring shape.,0.9
54,B,I agree with Agents one and three that black sheep absorbing more sunlight heat provides the most logical explanation for differing food intake compared to white sheep.,1.0
55,A,"I agree with Agents one and two that the girls being triplets allows them to share parents, birthdays, appearances but still not be identical twins. Agent three's answer seems unlikely.",0.9
56,A,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that if the ground was not wet, there would be no need for the third man to take special measures to keep his feet dry.",1.0
57,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the fat dog being the mother logically explains the relationship described while adhering to the details provided.",1.0
58,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the guards facing each other allows one to see the other smiling, despite monitoring opposite directions.",1.0
59,D,"I agree with Agents one and three that Christmas and New Year's fall in the same year every year, not meeting any of the specific criteria provided in the other answer choices. ",1.0
60,A,"I agree with Agents two and three that the color of the yellow stone would not transfer to the white shirt, so the shirt would remain white. The stone's color does not affect the shirt.",0.95
61,B,"I agree with all three agents that if the other end of the rope tied to the lion is untied, the lion can move freely within the 6m length to reach the human 7m away. This explains how the lion can access the 7m distance while tied to a 6m rope.",1.0
62,B,I agree with all three agents that only the legs touching the ground should be counted - the 4 legs of the bed and your 2 legs. The animals on the bed do not contribute legs on the ground.,1.0
63,B,"I agree she must have fallen into her apartment rather than to the ground, avoiding a long 20-story fall, which explains her minor injuries. All agents suggested the same.",1.0
64,C,I agree with Agent three that women can shave facial hair frequently but still maintain some beard growth. The other choices are unlikely to shave repeatedly yet keep a beard.,0.9
65,A,"I agree with Agent two that gently dropping the egg reduces impact force, making it less likely to crack on the hard concrete floor.",0.95
66,C,"I agree the man reading braille explains how he read without light, as Agents one and two suggested.",0.95
67,B,"I agree with all agents that the tractor was driven over the frozen lake in winter, aligning with the problem constraints.",1.0
68,C,I agree with all agents that the math teacher could understand the numerical work despite French language.,1.0
69,A,I agree the horse named Sunday explains the confusing timing. All agents suggested this.,1.0
70,C,I agree gently tossing the ball reduces impact force and risk of breaking. All agents gave this rationale.,1.0
71,A,I agree with Agents two and three that Emily being Lisa's mother logically explains why Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's niece. This family connection makes the most sense.,1.0
72,D,"I agree with Agents two and three that the police would not be the ones putting out a fire, as that is the role of firefighters. This seems to be a trick question.",1.0
73,C,"I agree with all agents that the math teacher could understand the numerical concepts in Sally's test despite it being in French, since math is consistent across languages.",1.0
74,B,I agree with all agents that jumping from the ground floor rather than the roof explains the lack of injury from the fall.,1.0
75,C,I agree with all agents that falling just a small height from the first ladder step would prevent any significant injury to the boy.,1.0
76,A,I agree with all agents that fluctuating tides explains why boats become grounded then can float again. This aligns with the village scenario.,1.0
77,B,"I agree with all agents that a publisher oversees publishing books without writing the content, aligning with the clues.",1.0
78,B,"I agree the man reading braille without light sources present best explains the situation, as all agents suggested.",1.0
79,A,I agree with Agents two and three that an unsecured floating station drifting away provides the most logical explanation for how the boat ended up adrift.,1.0
80,D,I agree with Agents two and three that none of the options explain how an egg could be unbroken after hitting a hard rock wall. This seems to be a trick question.,1.0
81,A,I agree with Agent two that people jumping off the boat into the sea seems to be the most plausible explanation for their sudden disappearance.,0.95
82,B,I agree with Agents two and three that the color of the white shirt would remain unchanged after being immersed in the red sea water. The analogies in the question do not apply to dyeing fabric.,0.95
83,A,"I agree with Agents one and three that the slope allows the office worker to conveniently walk downhill to each coffee shop, aligning with his habits.",0.9
84,D,I agree with Agents two and three that none of the options sufficiently explain the discrepancy between the restaurant's claim of full booking and being visibly empty later. More context is needed.,0.8
85,B,I concur with Agents one and two that falling from the first ladder step explains the lack of injury from his high overall fall.,0.95
86,C,"I agree with all agents that Mary must be the fifth child referred to in the question, so the fifth child's name is Mary.",1.0
87,D,"I concur with Agent three that the question does not provide enough information to determine which room firefighters, not police, would prioritize extinguishing.",0.8
88,B,I agree with Agent two's mathematical derivation that the runner completed 6 km on the first day of the marathon.,0.95
89,C,I concur with Agents one and two that driving over the frozen lake in winter is the only plausible explanation provided for the tractor reaching the isolated island.,0.95
90,D,"I agree with Agent two that none of the suggested answers are valid, since they rely on flawed assumptions about the daily increase in the fisherman's catch.",0.95
91,C,I concur with Agent three that Jack and Tony having different mothers explains why Tony's nephew is not also Jack's nephew.,1.0
92,D,"I agree with Agents Two and Three that the question does not provide enough information to determine how many birds remained after the gunshot, as they may have all flown away.",0.9
93,A,I concur with all three agents that the man working at the restaurant provides a logical explanation for how he eats there daily without paying.,1.0
94,C,"I agree with all three agents that option C - Each daughter shares the same brother - is the correct explanation here. The key phrase is ""each of her daughters has one brother"" which implies the daughters are all referring to the same brother, not separate individual brothers. This allows there to be 4 daughters and 1 shared brother totaling just 5 children for Mrs. Jones. The agents provide sound rationale that matches my own analysis.",1.0
95,B,"I concur with Agents One and Two that option B (Five heads) is the right answer. The question specifies 5 leaders of the organization are present, so there are 5 ""heads"" in the metaphorical sense of organizational heads, not literal physical heads. The agents' explanations match my interpretation.  ",1.0
96,B,"I agree with Agents One, Two and Three that option B (His horse was called Sunday) logically resolves the apparent contradiction here. If the man's horse is named Sunday, that would explain how he could leave on Sunday and return on Sunday, since it refers to his horse's name rather than the actual day of the week. The agents provide sound reasoning that I agree with.",1.0
97,C,"I concur with all three agents' logic that option C (The stations and his home are on a hill) best explains why the student chooses the boarding locations, since the hill allows him to easily ride downhill on his scooter when commuting. The agents' rationales align with my own analysis.",1.0  
98,A,I agree with the other agents that option A (Each player shares the same coach) logically explains how there can be 5 players and 1 coach totaling just 6 participants. The key is that they share a coach rather than having separate individual coaches. The agents provide good explanations that match my assessment.,1.0
99,B,"I concur with Agents Two and Three that option B (Emily and William share same father but not mother) logically explains why Lisa is only related to William. If they have different mothers, Lisa would only be related through William's mother's side. The agents provide sound reasoning that I agree with.",1.0
100,B,"I agree with the agents that option B (The stations and his home are on a hill) best explains why the student chooses those stops, since the hill allows easy downhill rides. The agents provide good rationales that match my own analysis.",1.0
101,C,"I agree with Agents One and Two that the firemen would most likely detain the unmasked individuals as the more probable burglary suspects, as indicated by option C. Covering faces is common for burglars, so unmasked people leaving would be suspicious. The agents provide reasonable explanations that align with my assessment.",0.95
102,A,"I concur with all three agents that if the rope's other end is untied (option A), the dog can roam freely within the rope's length, allowing it to reach the bone 7m away. The agents provide logical explanations that match my own analysis.",1.0
103,C,I agree with all three agents that Jessica reading braille (option C) explains how she reads in complete darkness and why her parents support her. The agents provide sound rationales that align with my interpretation.,1.0
104,C,"I concur with Agents One, Two and Three that the horse being named Sunday (option C) logically resolves the apparent contradiction, by allowing the man to ride out and back on ""Sunday."" The agents provide good explanations that match my own analysis.",1.0
105,C,"I agree with Agents One and Two that option C provides the most plausible explanation for how the pet could survive the fall unharmed. If the pet jumped back into the apartment from the balcony, it would only fall the height of one story rather than the full 17 stories, greatly reducing potential injury. The other agents provide logical rationale aligning with my analysis.",0.95
106,D,"I concur with Agents One and Two that option D is correct, as firing a gun does not necessarily mean a bird was hit or killed. Without knowing if any birds were affected, we cannot determine the number remaining. The agents provide sound explanations matching my own reasoning.",1.0
107,B,"I agree with all three agents that a preacher officiating weddings without being married himself, as stated in option B, logically resolves the paradox presented. The agents' rationales align with my interpretation.",1.0
108,C,"I concur with all three agents that Mary must be the unnamed fifth child referred to, as stated in option C. The other agents provide logical explanations that match my analysis.",1.0
109,B,"I agree with Agents Two and Three that since three students are named, Ana must be the fourth student as the question states there are four total. Option B is correct. The agents provide sound reasoning aligning with mine.",1.0
110,B,"I concur with Agents One and Two that the woman falling back into her apartment from the balcony, as stated in option B, best explains her minimal injuries from the fall. A 20-story vertical drop would be far more harmful. The agents provide good rationales that I agree with.  ",1.0
111,B,"I agree with Agents One and Three that a barber shaving customers while still maintaining their own beard, as option B states, resolves the paradox. The agents provide logical explanations that match my own analysis.",1.0
112,A,"I concur with Agents Two and Three that using translation tools or seeking outside help, as stated in option A, is the most plausible way the students could complete English homework without knowing the language. The agents provide sound rationales that align with my interpretation.",1.0
113,C,"I agree with Agents Two and Three that the color of the shirt would not intrinsically change when thrown into the sea, as stated in option C. The earlier examples do not apply the same way. The agents provide good explanations matching my analysis.",1.0
114,A,"I concur with Agents Two and Three that the people likely jumped off the boat during the observer's brief distraction, as suggested in option A. This explains their sudden disappearance from the boat. The agents provide logical rationales that I agree with.",0.95
115,B,"I agree with Agents One and Three that starting with 1 fish on day one, and adding 3 each subsequent day, fits the total catch of 30 fish over 5 days. Therefore, option B is correct that the fisherman caught 1 fish on the first day. The agents provide logical explanations that match my analysis.",1.0
116,C,"I concur with all three agents that the internet disconnection, as stated in option C, prevented Bob from accessing and searching Google. The agents provide sound rationales aligning with my own reasoning.",1.0  
117,B,"I agree with all three agents that a preacher officiating weddings without being married himself, as option B states, logically explains the paradox presented. The agents provide good explanations matching my interpretation.",1.0
118,B,"I concur with Agents Two and Three that only the bed legs plus the human legs are touching the floor, totaling six legs as stated in option B. The animal legs on the bed do not count. The agents provide logical rationales that I agree with.",1.0
119,C,"I agree with all three agents that the daughters sharing one brother, as stated in option C, logically explains there being only 5 children total. The agents provide sound explanations matching my own analysis.",1.0
