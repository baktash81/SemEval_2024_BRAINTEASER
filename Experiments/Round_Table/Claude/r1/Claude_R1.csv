,Solution,Reasoning,Confidence
0,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is A. The key information is that the lazy farmer is the parent of the diligent farmer, but is not the father. This strongly implies the lazy farmer is the mother, as the agents' reasoning explains. The language used does not specify gender roles, so assuming the lazy farmer is female based on not being the father logically follows. I agree this satisfies the information given without making unnecessary assumptions.",0.95
1,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is C. Their reasoning that Romeo and Juliet being fish whose tank broke from the train's vibrations best fits the details of glass shards, water and proximity to the railroad track is sound. This provides a sensible explanation for how they could have died in the sparse bedroom with only a bed and shelf. The other options are less plausible based on the information provided.",0.9
2,C,"I agree with Agents 1 and 2 that the answer is C. Their explanation that every year, the day before your birthday you are one year younger than you will be the next day on your birthday is logical and accurate. This happens annually. Agent 3's reasoning that this only occurs in the first year after graduation is incorrect - it happens every year regardless of graduation status. ",1.0
3,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is B. As they explain, if an assistant captain leaves a sports team, the existing captain would take on more responsibility and serve as the acting captain. The role would not automatically transfer to another officer. The captain is next in the hierarchy after the assistant captain, so they would naturally fill this leadership void.",0.95
4,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is C. Their mathematical explanations that 5% of a sample of 100 people is 5 people are logical. Since 5% of the city's population has unlisted numbers, 5 of 100 randomly selected names would be expected to have unlisted numbers. The calculation and reasoning are sound.",1.0
5,A,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that the answer is A. Their reasoning that the guards must have been facing each other, not back-to-back, for one to see the other smiling makes sense. Agent 2 provides additional detail supporting this as well. For one guard to observe the other's facial expression, they need to be positioned side-by-side within view, rather than turned away. This fits the logic of the scenario best.",0.95
6,A,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that the answer is A. Their explanation that the man bet his dog could jump higher than a house, which cannot physically jump, is the key logical point. The bet was based on a play on words that a house cannot jump at all. Agent 2's reasoning about a small house does not fit as cleanly with the bet described.",0.95
7,B,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that the answer is B. Their explanation that 100 divided by 10 equals 10, and you can only perform this division once to get a whole number result is logically sound. Agent 2 mentions you could technically divide again, but I concur that for the initial division of 100 by 10, it can only be done once. The reasoning is mathematically accurate.",1.0
8,A,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that the answer is A. Their math showing 10% of 200 criminals is 20 criminals makes sense. Agent 2 attempts a more complex estimation approach, but Agents 1 and 3 show the direct calculation based on the information given that 10% of 200 is 20. Their logic and math are straightforward and convincing.",1.0  
9,B,I agree with Agents 2 and 3 that the answer is B. Their explanation that Christmas on Dec 25 and New Years on Jan 1 fall within the same calendar year every year is logically sound. Agent 1 is incorrect that they fall in different years. The other agents' reasoning accurately reflects the standard calendar system.,1.0
10,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is B. Their explanation that roosters are male chickens and cannot lay eggs is scientifically accurate. Only female chickens (hens) lay eggs. The farmer receiving no eggs despite feeding his roosters makes sense given this biological fact about roosters. The agents provide clear, aligned reasoning.",1.0
11,D,I don't agree with Agents. The key reason is that the question simply does not provide enough specific information to justify choosing any of the other answer options confidently. we don't know:,0.9
12,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is C. Their explanation that the man staying dry was in a coffin at his own funeral while the others got wet running in the rain provides a logical twist that fits the details given. I concur that this interpretation creatively reconciles why only that man remained dry based on the church setting and him staying still.",0.95
13,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is A. Their reasoning that the woman was likely at a zoo, where bears are safely in enclosures, convincingly explains why she was excited rather than afraid. This context justifies her reaction, as the agents highlight.",0.95
14,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that answer B makes the most sense. If the houses were wall-to-wall, the man could feasibly jump or step from one to the other, rather than needing exceptional athleticism. The agents provide clear, aligned explanations supporting this interpretation based on the scenario details.",0.95
15,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that the answer is B. Their explanation that the accountant being the attorney's sister logically reconciles how she can testify being his brother while he truthfully states not having a brother. The reasoning that the gender-neutral term ""sibling"" allows both statements to be true is sound.",0.95
16,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that A is the answer. As they clearly explain, if the accountant is the attorney's sister, she could truthfully claim him as her brother while he does not have a brother. The agents provide aligned, convincing reasoning for how this relationship resolves the apparent contradiction.",0.95
17,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the logical answer. Their reasoning that the group consists of 1 daughter, 1 mother, and 1 grandmother as the 2 mothers and 2 daughters makes sense. This family structure accounts for the equal $7 split. The agents offer clear explanatory reasoning.",0.95
18,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the answer. Their explanation that if all 9 children are boys, then half (4.5 rounded to 5) would be boys logically follows. The reasoning that the children could be from different families also supports the possibility of all being boys. The agents provide sound interpretations.  ",0.95
19,A,"After reviewing the agents' explanations, I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that the answer is A. Their reasoning that taking the 3 medicines every half hour over the course of 1.5 hours logically follows the details provided. Agent 2's calculation of 2 hours does not account for the full timeframe. The step-by-step reasoning of taking the doses each half hour for 1.5 hours total is convincing.",1.0
20,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that A is the correct answer. Their explanation that the man bet his dog could jump higher than a house, which cannot physically jump, is logically sound. This play on words underpins why the man won the bet, as the agents highlight.",0.95
21,A,"I agree with Agent 2 that A is the answer. The question does not provide any information that suggests the person was walking on stilts or on his hands. Therefore, options B and C can be ruled out. The most plausible explanation, given the information provided, is that the ground was not wet, which is why the person’s feet remained dry even though they did not have rubber boots. ",0.95
22,B,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that B is the answer. As they logically explain, roosters do not lay eggs as male chickens. Therefore, the scenario described is not possible. The agents provide scientifically accurate and aligned reasoning.",1.0
23,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that A is the answer. Their reasoning that James was likely at a zoo where bears are safely enclosed, which would explain their lack of attack, is logically sound. This context makes sense of the scenario given. The agents provide aligned explanations.",0.95
24,A,"After reviewing the agents' explanations, I agree with Agents 2 and 3 that A is the correct answer. Their step-by-step reasoning of taking each pill every 30 minutes for a total of 1.5 hours matches the details provided. Agent 1's calculation of 2 hours does not fully account for the timeframe.",1.0
25,A,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that A is the answer. As they explain, subtracting 10 from 100 once results in 90, and further subtractions would not yield whole numbers. Agent 2 mentions subtracting twice, but I concur that technically only one full subtraction is possible based on the starting 100 figure.",1.0
26,A,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that A is the logical answer. As the agents explain, if the girls were triplets, they could share genetics and background while still having distinct identities. This would allow them to answer the questions as described. The triplet explanation reconciles the apparent contradiction.",0.95
27,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the answer. Their reasoning that Romeo and Juliet being fish whose tank likely broke from the train vibrations fits the details of glass, water, and the nearby tracks. This provides a logical explanation that is missing from the other options. The agents offer aligned interpretations.",0.9
28,A,"I agree with Agents 1 and 3 that A is the correct answer. As they explain, if the vice coach cannot attend, the head coach would naturally take over leading the team. Agent 2's suggestion of the captain does not fit the hierarchy as cleanly. The head coach replacing the vice coach makes the most sense.",0.95
29,C,"I agree with Agent 1 that C is the best answer. As they state, The question states that someone screamed “No John, not the gun!” This indicates that the person who had the gun was named John. The cop saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body. If we assume that the doctor and lawyer were females (as suggested by option C), then the only male person left is the mail man. Therefore, the cop could deduce that the mail man, presumably named John, was the one who had the gun.",0.8
30,A,"After reviewing the agents' explanations, I agree with Agents 2 and 3 that A makes the most sense. As they state, older adults may require specific dietary adjustments to address health and metabolism changes associated with aging. This provides a logical reason for increased food consumption.",0.9
31,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the correct answer. Their reasoning that if Jack is a fish, being knocked from the ocean onto land could plausibly lead to death within minutes makes logical sense. This provides a reasonable interpretation of the unusual scenario. The agents offer aligned explanations.",0.9
32,C,"I concur with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the answer. Their explanation that the fat dog being the mother of the slim dog explains their parental relationship matches the information provided. As the agents state, this accounts for the fat dog not being specified as the father. The reasoning is sound.",1.0
33,C,"I agree with Agents 1, 2 and 3 that C is the logical answer. As they explain, roosters are male chickens that cannot lay eggs. Therefore, the scenario of the rooster laying an egg described could not occur. The agents provide accurate, aligned scientific reasoning.",1.0
34,C,"I agree with Agents 2 and 3 that C makes the most sense. Their reasoning that the dry man was likely a statue or photograph being honored at the match, while the others were living people, logically explains why he stayed dry. Agent 1's suggestion is also possible. The statue/photo interpretation reconciles the unusual scenario.  ",0.85
35,C,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the answer is C. If there is a grandmother present along with a mother and daughter, that accounts for the ""two mothers"" (the mother and grandmother) and ""two daughters"" (the daughter and her mother who is the grandmother's daughter). This equals three people who can split the $21 equally.",1.0
36,B,I agree with Agents one and three that 5% of 100 people randomly selected would equal 5 people with unlisted numbers. Agent two's logic that a phone directory contains only listed numbers is flawed.,1.0
37,A,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that answer A makes the most sense - if the man was in a coffin at his own funeral, that explains why he remained dry while the others fled and got wet in the rain.",1.0
38,C,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that Jack and Tom being brothers with the same parents enables the $40 to be split equally among the four of them. This is the only logical explanation.",1.0
39,C,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that answer C is correct. The logic that black sheep absorb more heat from sunlight, potentially causing them to eat less to regulate body temperature, explains the differing food consumption.",0.9
40,B,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the woman was likely at a zoo, explaining why she was excited instead of afraid to see a bear from a safe distance.",1.0
41,B,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that John cleverly predicted the score would be 0-0 before the start of the game, an easy correct prediction that led Tom to lose the bet.",1.0
42,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that John used the same clever score prediction tactic for the basketball game, stating the score would be 0-0 before tipoff, causing Tom to lose this bet as well.",1.0
43,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the captain would take over leadership duties if the assistant captain resigned from the team. This follows the typical hierarchy.",1.0
44,B,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that you can only subtract 10 from 100 twice before reaching zero, making B the correct answer.",1.0
45,C,"I agree with Agent one that if all 11 sheep are white, then half of 11 sheep (5.5 rounded up to 6 sheep) would be white. Agents two and three's answers are flawed.",1.0
46,C,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that if the officer was actually James's sister, her statement makes sense along with James having no brother.",1.0
47,C,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that if all 9 children are boys, half of them (4.5 rounded to 5) would be male.",1.0
48,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the boys being triplets would allow them to share parents, house, birthdate but still not be twins.",1.0
49,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that if the ground was dry, there would be no need for the third man to take special measures to keep his feet dry. This explains why his feet remain dry despite not wearing boots.",1.0
50,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that John cleverly predicted the football game score would be 0-0 before start, which is always correct, causing Tom to lose the bet.",1.0
51,A,"I agree with Agents one, two, and three that the mailman being the only male present allowed the officer to quickly deduce ""John"" referred to him when hearing that statement.",1.0
52,C,"I agree with Agent three that with 5 stops of 30 minutes each, the total stop time is 2 hours. Agents one and two did not account for all the stops.",1.0
53,B,I agree with Agent one that a circular tank would allow the fish to see each other periodically while swimming opposite ways around the ring shape.,0.9
54,B,I agree with Agents one and three that black sheep absorbing more sunlight heat provides the most logical explanation for differing food intake compared to white sheep.,1.0
55,A,"I agree with Agents one and two that the girls being triplets allows them to share parents, birthdays, appearances but still not be identical twins. Agent three's answer seems unlikely.",0.9
56,A,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that if the ground was not wet, there would be no need for the third man to take special measures to keep his feet dry.",1.0
57,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the fat dog being the mother logically explains the relationship described while adhering to the details provided.",1.0
58,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the guards facing each other allows one to see the other smiling, despite monitoring opposite directions.",1.0
59,D,"I agree with Agents one and three that Christmas and New Year's fall in the same year every year, not meeting any of the specific criteria provided in the other answer choices.",1.0
60,A,"I agree with Agents two and three that the white shirt would not take on the yellow stone's color, and would remain white.",1.0
61,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that if the other end of the rope is untied, it provides the lion 6m of reach which is enough to get to 7m where the human is.",1.0
62,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that since the animals are not actually touching the ground, only the bed's four legs and your two legs count.",1.0
63,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that falling back into her apartment from the balcony best explains the outcome described in the situation.",1.0
64,C,I agree with Agent three that women who may have some natural facial hair can shave three times a day but still maintain a beard.,1.0
65,C,I agree with Agents two and three that concrete floors are too hard to crack from an egg drop. Agent one's logic is flawed.,1.0
66,C,I agree with Agents one and two that the man reading braille explains how he read with no light sources present.,0.95
67,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the frozen lake during winter provides the only plausible explanation for how the tractor reached the island.",1.0
68,C,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the math test used universal numbers the teacher could understand despite it being in French.",1.0
69,A,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that the horse being named Sunday provides the explanation for the timing in the question seeming contradictory.",1.0
70,C,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that gently tossing the fragile glass ball reduces impact force against the sturdy wall.",1.0
71,A,I agree with Agents two and three that Emily being Lisa's mother explains why Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's niece.,1.0

78,B,"I agree with Agents one, two and three that reading braille without light sources present logically explains the situation.",1.0
79,A,I agree with Agents two and three that an unsecured floating station drifting away best explains how the boat ended up adrift in the ocean.,1.0
80,D,I agree with Agent Two that throwing or dropping a raw egg onto any hard surface will break it due to the fragile shell. This seems to be a trick question meant to subvert assumptions - it is physically impossible to throw an egg against a rock wall without cracking it.,0.95
81,A,"I agree with Agent Two that out of the options, people jumping off the boat into the sea seems the most plausible explanation for why they suddenly disappeared from view.",0.85
82,C,"I agree with Agent One that the color would likely transfer from the red sea water to the white shirt, turning it red.",0.95
83,A,"I agree with Agents One and Three that the slope facilitates walking downhill in both directions, which explains the worker's coffee shop habits.",0.9
84,D,"I agree with Agent Two that the provided answer options do not sufficiently explain why the restaurant told the customer all tables were booked, despite being empty later. There could be various reasons for this discrepancy, like overbooking reservations or a change in dining rush hours. More context is needed to determine the exact reason.  ",0.6
85,B,"I concur with Agents One and Two that if the young man fell from the first step of a 100-foot ladder, the short distance would prevent serious injury upon impact. This aptly explains how he was unharmed.",0.95
86,C,"I agree with Agents One and Two that Mary must be the fifth child referred to, since the question states ""Mary's father has five children.""",1.0
87,D,I concur with Agent Three that the riddle does not provide sufficient information to determine which room firefighters would prioritize. Putting out fires is generally not a police responsibility.,0.8
88,B,"I agree with Agent Two's mathematical derivation that the runner completed 6 km on the first day. This fits the total distance of 70 km run over 5 days, with a 2 km increase each subsequent day.",0.95
89,C,I concur with Agents One and Two that driving the tractor over the frozen lake in winter is the only plausible explanation provided for how it reached the isolated island.,0.95
90,B,"I agree with Agents One and Three that if the fisherman caught 30 fish total over 5 days, and the catch increased by 3 fish each subsequent day, he must have started with 1 fish on the first day. This fits the pattern of increase.",1.0
