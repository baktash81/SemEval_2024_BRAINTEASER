The fact that the woman was at the zoo explains why she did not feel fear when encountering a bear, as she knew that the animal was safely contained. The other options do not provide a reasonable explanation for the woman's behavior, and therefore are less likely to be correct. Option A is incorrect because attempting to scare the bear would not explain why the woman felt excited rather than frightened. Option C is also incorrect because it does not account for the woman's knowledge of the bear's containment at the zoo.

We can start by considering the differences between white and black sheep in terms of their physical characteristics. White sheep have a light-colored coat, while black sheep have a dark-colored coat.\\n\\nOne possible explanation for why white sheep might consume more food than black sheep is that white sheep may need to eat more to maintain their body temperature. Since white sheep have a light-colored coat, they may lose heat more quickly than black sheep, which could lead to hypothermia if they do not consume enough calories to generate body heat. In contrast, black sheep may be better insulated due to their dark-colored coat, which could help them conserve heat and require fewer calories to maintain their body temperature.\\n\\nAnother factor to consider is the amount of energy required for maintenance of the coat color. White sheep may need to expend more energy to keep their coat clean and free of dirt, whereas black sheep may require less energy for coat maintenance since their dark coloration can mask dirt and stains more effectively.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, it appears that option C - \"Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature\" - is the best explanation for why white sheep consume more food than black sheep.\\n\\nConfidence: 0.8\\n\\nMy confidence level for this answer is 0.8, indicating a probability of 80% that my answer is correct. While I believe that the reasoning provided above is sound, there may be other factors at play that affect the feed consumption patterns of white and black sheep that are not considered here.

The probability of a person not having an unlisted phone number is then q = 1 - p = 0.95.\\n\\nThe number of successes (people with unlisted phone numbers) in a sample of 100 names is represented by X ~ Bin(n=100, p=0.05).\\n\\nUsing the formula for the mean of a binomial distribution, we can calculate the expected value of X: E(X) = np = 100 \\\\* 0.05 = 5.\\n\\nNow, we want to find the probability of exactly 5 people having unlisted phone numbers in the sample of 100 names. We can use the formula for the probability mass function (pmf) of a binomial distribution:\\n\\nP(X=k) = (n choose k) \\\\* p^k \\\\* q^(n-k)\\n\\nwhere k = 5.

We can start by considering the differences between white and black sheep in terms of their physical characteristics. White sheep have a light-colored coat, while black sheep have a dark-colored coat.\\n\\nOne possible explanation for why white sheep might consume more food than black sheep is that white sheep may need to eat more to maintain their body temperature. Since white sheep have a light-colored coat, they may lose heat more quickly than black sheep, which could lead to hypothermia if they do not consume enough calories to generate body heat. In contrast, black sheep may be better insulated due to their dark-colored coat, which could help them conserve heat and require fewer calories to maintain their body temperature.\\n\\nAnother factor to consider is the amount of energy required for maintenance of the coat color. White sheep may need to expend more energy to keep their coat clean and free of dirt, whereas black sheep may require less energy for coat maintenance since their dark coloration can mask dirt and stains more effectively.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, it appears that option C - \"Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature\" - is the best explanation for why white sheep consume more food than black sheep.\\n\\nConfidence: 0.8\\n\\nMy confidence level for this answer is 0.8, indicating a probability of 80% that my answer is correct.

We can start by considering the differences between white and black sheep in terms of their physical characteristics. White sheep have a light-colored coat, while black sheep have a dark-colored coat.\\n\\nOne possible explanation for why white sheep might consume more food than black sheep is that white sheep may need to eat more to maintain their body temperature. Since white sheep have a light-colored coat, they may lose heat more quickly than black sheep, which could lead to hypothermia if they do not consume enough calories to generate body heat. In contrast, black sheep may be better insulated due to their dark-colored coat, which could help them conserve heat and require fewer calories to maintain their body temperature.\\n\\nAnother factor to consider is the amount of energy required for maintenance of the coat color. White sheep may need to expend more energy to keep their coat clean and free of dirt, whereas black sheep may require less energy for coat maintenance since their dark coloration can mask dirt and stains more effectively.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, it appears that option C - \"Black absorbs more heat from sunlight, black sheep may eat less to avoid overheating or to regulate their body temperature\" - is the best explanation for why white sheep consume more food than black sheep.\\n\\n',\n",
